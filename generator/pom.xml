  <description>
    XML Toolkit is a comprehensive framework to facilitate the use of XML in software languages such as Java. This framework
    intends to provide tools that will allow a developer to easily integrate XML interoperability, bind XML Schemas,
    and analyze XML Schemas for use with any software. Currently there is only one language and one application
    that is supported: XML Binding in Java. Next on the agenda is the development of analysis tools for XML Schema Documents.
    For instance, imagine a tool that will allow you to determine whether an XSD complies to best-practices. This tool
    will: 1) produce warnings for structures that do not comply to best-practices, 2) tell the developer whether the logical
    structure can be transformed linearly to a form that complies to best-practices, and 3) to automatically produce an XSD
    that maintains the logical structure of the original document but now fully complies to best-practices. This is just one of many
    tools that will be available shortly. In the meantime, check out the binding application.
